Project Title: Emai Bot

Project Description: 
Main.py: This project was built to help a company advertise their time lapse camera products by sending out mass, customized emails to 22,000 companies, 
whose names and email addresses are listed on an Excel spreadsheet. I created this bot that scrapes the spreadsheet and puts together an email with their names, sending individual emails to each person. It uses Gmail's API and Google Cloud Console to allow sending of messages through the code. It sends around 2000 emails in around half an hour.

get_emails.py: 
If emails are rejected automatically, this bot collects the email addresses that were rejected if needed, by scraping the emails and using regex to match and cross-reference emails. 

It took me around 3 hours to code this.
